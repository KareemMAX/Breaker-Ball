# Breaker Ball
 This was a small school project I made (to join a competition in which it turned out to be a scam ðŸ˜¢). This **Golden** piece of code was written back in 2016 when I was in 9th grade.
 
 Please note that I have uploaded this repository without changing any code nor texture. All of these findings are in there original form (just added a comment in the Editor).

 ## How do I play this game?
 I am pretty sure that you will run the game. Click on start. Select level 1. Then samsh the arrow buttons and the space bar to play.
 It turned out that you should play with your **Mouse**. Just left click and move your mouse to control the paddle. Awesome isn't it ðŸ˜….
 
 ## Browse??
 Yes... You can create new levels and play them with the browse option. Also you can play the development levels included in the release. Try `0.lvl` it is the best one ðŸ˜‚.
 
 ## How do I use the editor?
 Easy. Open the editor. Then you will have 3 buttons and a slidebar with a block next to it. 
 Drag the slidebar to discover all blocks. Use **Save** to save the level and **Load** to edit existing levels. **Dev** is a development tool so just leave it.
 Now click on empty place to put a block. Or click on a block to remove it.

 ## How did you make this??
 This project was made with VB.net. I used a library called [OpenTK](https://opentk.net/) with is an awesome library to access OpenGL APIs in .Net. I remember that I have learned a lot of staff back then such as some Highschool math, figuring out equations, file systems and mouse event handlers which I think it was new to me (I am surprised that I made this in my 9th grade to be honest).
 
 Yeah.. That is it. If you want anything be my guest ðŸ˜‚.
